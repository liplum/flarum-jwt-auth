            expirationLeeway: Expiration Leeway (seconds)
            expirationLeewayHelp: >
                How many additional seconds past JWT expiration should the session still start.
                This value is only intended to be a few minutes at worst to account for clock skew times between servers.
                However it can also be set to a much longer value if this is the only way to work around fixed short lifetimes of JWT from an external library.
            registrationHook: Registration Hook URL
            registrationHookHelp: >
                A fully qualified URL that will be hit with a POST request when a user visits the forum for the first time.
                The request should return a JSON:API payload that will be used to create the new user in Flarum.

                This iframe will be loaded off-screen on all pages of the Flarum single page application.
                It can be used to periodically refresh the cookie and can use browser messaging to trigger a page refresh for auto-login or auto-logout.
                See README for documentation.

            autoLoginDelayHelp: >

            logoutRedirectHelp: >
                During a JWT stateless session, the Flarum logout link will be replaced with a link pointing to this URL.
