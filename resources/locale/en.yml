            expirationLeeway: Expiration Leeway (seconds)
            expirationLeewayHelp: >
                How many additional seconds past JWT expiration should the session still start.
                This value is only intended to be a few minutes at worst to account for clock skew times between servers.
                However it can also be set to a much longer value if this is the only way to work around fixed short lifetimes of JWT from an external library.
            registrationHook: Registration Hook URL
            registrationHookHelp: >
                A fully qualified URL that will be hit with a POST request when a user visits the forum for the first time.
                The request should return a JSON:API payload that will be used to create the new user in Flarum.
                Use <code>{sub}</code> syntax to use an attribute from the JWT in the URL.
                The complete JWT will be passed in the <code>Authorization</code> header.
                Username and Email are optional if a template value is configured.
            authorizationHeader: Custom Authorization header value
            authorizationHeaderHelp: If this field is left empty, <code>Authorization</code> header will contain <code>Token <JWT token></code>.
            hiddenIframe: Hidden Iframe URL
            hiddenIframeHelp: >
                This iframe will be loaded off-screen on all pages of the Flarum single page application.
                It can be used to periodically refresh the cookie and can use browser messaging to trigger a page refresh for auto-login or auto-logout.
                See README for documentation.
            autoLoginDelay: Hidden Iframe Auto Login Delay (milliseconds)
            autoLoginDelayHelp: >
                During how many seconds the page is allowed to refresh without user interaction if the hidden iframe returns a logged in status.
                Past that delay, the user will receive an alert to ask whether they want to refresh the page.
            logoutRedirect: Logout Redirect URL
            logoutRedirectHelp: >
                During a JWT stateless session, the Flarum logout link will be replaced with a link pointing to this URL.
                If no value is set, the logout button will be hidden.

        alert:
            refresh: Refresh page
            login: You have been connected automatically.
