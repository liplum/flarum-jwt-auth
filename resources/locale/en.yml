      help: |
        For security issue, you should set this in your "config.php" like below:

        <code>
        "liplum-jwt-auth" => array(
            "jwtSecret" => "access_token_secret"

    expirationLeeway:

      help: >
        How many additional seconds past JWT expiration should the session still start.
        This value is only intended to be a few minutes at worst to account for clock skew times between servers.
        However it can also be set to a much longer value if this is the only way to work around fixed short lifetimes of JWT from an external library.
    registrationHook:
      label: Registration Hook URL
      help: >
        A fully qualified URL that will be hit with a POST request when a user visits the forum for the first time.

        If this field is left empty, <code>Authorization</code> header will contain <code>"Token <JWT token>"</code>.

        For security issue, you should set this in your "config.php" like below:

        <code>
        "liplum-jwt-auth" => array(
            "jwtSecret" => "access_token_secret"

    hiddenIframe:
      label: Hidden Iframe URL
      help: >
        This iframe will be loaded off-screen on all pages of the Flarum single page application.
        It can be used to periodically refresh the cookie and can use browser messaging to trigger a page refresh for auto-login or auto-logout.
        See README for documentation.

      help: >
